// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Prompt user for numbers
Num1 = User Input
Num2 = User Input

Num1 + Num2 = sum 
console.writeline(" the sum of both numbers is  ");
console.write(sum);

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

prompt user for number
Num1 = User Input
Rem1 = Num1 / 2
If (Rem1 == 0)
	console.write("that number is even.");
Else
	console.write("that number is odd.");
	
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

writeline "Please input you numbers"
n1 = get user input
n2 = get user input
n3 = get user input
n4 = get user input
n5 = get user input

n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = Sum 
sum/5 = Avg
console.write("Your average is .");
console.write(Avg);

if (n1 > n2) set n2 to min 
else set n1 to min
if (n3 < min) set min to n3
if (n4 < min) set min to n4
if (n5 < min) set min to n5

if (n1 > n2) set n1 to max 
else set n2 to max
if (n3 < max) set max to n3
if (n4 < max) set max to n4
if (n5 < max) set max to n5

console.write("The Minimum is ");
console.write(min);
console.write("The Maximum is ");
console.write(max);
